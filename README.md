I learned what Git is useful for, the types of Version Control systems, how to use these tools.

Git helps handling the code version you need to use, without affecting the main branch, you can also rollback to an old version if needed.

I also learned multiple commands used for different actions, as well as the best practices that you need to follow.


The .gitignore part is new, as I hadn't used it before, learned how I can choose to ignore certain files.

The list of git commands was useful, as well as all the presentations. Concerning the tests in the first module, I think that the countdown could be a little longer, as 2 minutes is sometimes is not enough to be able to answer the questions.
